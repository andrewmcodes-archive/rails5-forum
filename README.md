# Rails 5 Forum App

This is a simple forum app built on Rails 5. The main objective for this app was to learn how to use the omniauth gem, and how it integrates with Twitter. 

I followed the "Building a Forum Application with Ruby on Rails 5 and Material Design" series by TechmakerTV on Youtube for this; however, the series was never finished. I extended the application using prior knowledge, but it is my opinion that the tutorial creator used very hack-y processes for building this app and would not recommend anything outside of the omniauth section.

If I decide to extend this further in the future, I would likely start fresh to avoid some of the issues that I later ran into when trying to modify the code.
